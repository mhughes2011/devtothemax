        <p class="inline-block">Thanks for stopping by!  I started my computer programming journey in 2019 and I’ve fallen in love!  I’m a Structural Engineer by schooling but man if I had it to do over again with the knowledge that I have now...who knows where I’d be!  Not sure if you’ve felt that before but I sure do.

        This journey has been amazing so far.  I love taking a blank document and making something that exists for the whole world to use!  I have a passion for making software tools and hopefully you’ll find some of what I’ve created useful!
        
        I’d love to connect!  Hit me up below and I look forward to meeting you!</p>
