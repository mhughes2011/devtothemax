    <!-- ABOUT ME -->

    <div class="w-3/4 mx-auto mb-10 items-center ">
        <p class="inline-block text-center mb-8">
            Thanks for stopping by!  I started my computer programming journey in 2019 and I’ve fallen in love!  I’m a Structural Engineer by schooling but man if I had it to do over again with the knowledge that I have now...who knows where I’d be!  Not sure if you’ve felt that before but I sure do.
            <br>
            This journey has been amazing so far.  I love taking a blank document and making something that exists for the whole world to use!  I have a passion for making software tools and hopefully you’ll find some of what I’ve created useful!
            <br>
            I’d <strong>love</strong> to connect!  Hit me up below and I look forward to meeting you!</p>
        <h1 class="inline-block py-5 px-12 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-2xl text-2xl font-bold">Hit Me Up!</h1>

        <p class="inline-block text-center mb-8">
            The major focus of my learning path is anything and everything JavaScript based.  After trying for several years to teach myself how to become a programmer, I kept getting lost and confused in all of the different technologies that are out there.  Because of that I decided to take a different approach.
            <br>
            Rather than blazing through HTML, CSS, and JS I decided to take a more focused approach to the internet from a basic building block perspective.  What I learned is that everything....EVERYTHING boils down to the basic building blocks of the Original 3.  After spending roughly 6 months on just the Original 3, things began to make total sense!

        <div>
            <h1>HTML5</h1>
            <p>Because everything needs structure, tags, sections, divs...asides...and forms...</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>CSS3</h1>
            <p>I know enough to be dangerous, not the strongest aspect of my development skills if I'm being honest.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>TailwindCSS</h1>
            <p>So far the framework I enjoy working with the most!  It's what styled this website (wink wink)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
            <p>The first framework I learned in my bootcamp!  Still having trouble with flexbox though.</p>

            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            <p>As weird as this will sound, JavaScript is my favorite language so far.  Especially with all of the frameworks!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>NodeJS</h1>
            <p>The fact that you don't need a browser to run JavaScript is awesome!  Thank you NodeJS...you unsung hero in the programming world!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>ExpressJS</h1>
            <p>Now this...this is what makes me happy.  For whatever reason Express just makes sense to me.  Great platform to build a back end on.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>ReactJS</h1>
            <p>It's the most popular front-end framework...I'd be stupid not to learn it right?</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>React Native</h1>
            <p>Facebook got it right with building this framework! I thought I was going to have to learn native coding for apps but then this beautiful tool comes along!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>MongoDB</h1>
            <p>I know it's the go to database for JavaScript based software but man do I love me some MongoDB! Best DB out there for beginners in my opinion!</p>
